Check in on development at:

## Todos
1. Convert main events on side nav to Handlebars templates and have them render via JS instead of Rails
2. Add checkboxes to routes in side nav to turn display on and off on the map
3. Implement centering of map over a route. Map should center on a route when you hover over it in the side nav

## Next up
- Create event submission and link with route submission
